# Breeds I Want!

**Here are some dog breeds I would consider getting:**

**Golden Doodles**
* Berkley is a Golden Doodle and he is a perfect boy!
* They also vary in sizes and can be big or mini which I go back and forth with my preference. 
* I love bigger dogs but I also love to carry dogs around so I am still debating. 

**Soft Coated Wheaten Terrior**
* My dog Roscoe was this breed and he was so handsome.
* I like how fluffy they are without having super curly hair.
* They are also a good meduim size dog (30-40lbs).

**Huskypoo**
* I had never heard of this breed before until my roommate showed me her other dog, Oakley.
* I think it is a perfect blend of the prior two dog breeds mentioned.
* They vary in sizes but their hair tends to be soft and fluffy.
