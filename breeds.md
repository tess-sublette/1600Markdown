# Breeds I Want!

*Here are some dog breeds I would consider getting:

**Golden Doodles**
Berkley is a Golden Doodle and he is a perfect boy!
They also vary in sizes and can be big or mini which I go back and forth with my preference. 
I love bigger dogs but I also love to carry dogs around so I am still debating. 

**Soft Coated Wheaten Terrior**
My dog Roscoe was this breed and he was so handsome.
I like how fluffy they are without having super curly hair.
They are also a good meduim size dog (30-40lbs).

**Huskypoo**
I had never heard of this breed before until my roommate showed me her other dog, Oakley.
I think it is a perfect blend of the prior two dog breeds mentioned.
They vary in sizes but their hair tends to be soft and fluffy.
